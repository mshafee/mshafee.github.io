Fablab or fabrication lab is a small scale workshop equipped with computer controlled tools with the aim to make prototypes or any parts


# Fab lab, MESCE
There are around 22 fablabs in kerala Mes college of engineering,Kuttippuram is one among them. They have a well develepod fablab in which student and faculty development programs are taking place. Fablab(MESCE) consists of the below mentioned machines.
1)3D Printer
2)Laser Cutting Machine
3)PCB Milling Machine
4)Vinyl Cutting Machine
5)Sand Plaster Machine

## 3D Printer

3D printer is a machine allowing the creation of a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession. 3D printer made by Ultimaker is use in mesce fab lab

## Laser Cutting Machine

For laser cutting, we design 2D dwawings using RHINOCEROS ,SKETCHUP, SOLIDWORKS or any similar software and convert it into pdf format. We can use laser cutter for cutting and engraving in various materials. We can adjust the power, speed,starting position..etc usin print setup. For step by step instructions to operate epilog laser cutter

## PCB Milling Machine

Printed circuit board milling (also: isolation milling) is the process of removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a layout file. 

## Vinyl Cutting Machine

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer control the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl). 

## Sand Plaster Machine
